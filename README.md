# Competitive Ad Spend Analysis Dashboard

This Streamlit app enables robust competitive media mix analysis using Nielsen Ad Intel and Pathmatics data.  
It supports uploading and parsing multiple Excel files, mapping advertiser and channel names, selecting a primary advertiser, and setting analysis date ranges. The app also supports branded, multi-format exports.

## Features

- Upload one or more Nielsen Ad Intel and Pathmatics Excel files (`.xls` or `.xlsx`).
- Automatic extraction and mapping of advertiser and media channel names.
- Interactive UI for renaming advertisers and channels.
- Set a primary advertiser and select an analysis date range.
- Dashboard view with context (charts and aggregation: TODO).
- Export options for Excel, CSV, PDF, and PNG (charts and reports: TODO).
- Monks logo preset in sidebar; upload your own client logo for custom branding.
- All exports titled:  
  `[Primary Advertiser Name] Competitor Ad Spend Analysis - [start date] to [end date]`

## Setup

1. Clone this repository.
2. Place the Monks logo in `static/monks_logo.png`.
